# Client Server system that classifies sneakers using Tensorflow &amp; Keras

This project consists of an Android Application that is connected to a LAMP server hosted on Digital Ocean. The user takes a picture of a pair of sneakers, then they upload it to the server and the result-prediction from the convolutional neural network is returned. The application is connected to the server through PHP to exchange data and then python (tensorflow and keras) is used for the machine learning algorithm in oder to make predictions. The system returns a result whether the pair of sneakers uploaded belong to Nike or Adidas.
